                    <h2>Estavius Von Gloopenheimer:</h2>
                    <p>Spellcaster seeking salvation</p>

                    <h2>Who is he?</h2>
                    <p>Estavius Von Gloopenheimer is an ancient wizard and former member of a shady secret society. After plotting an assassination of his king, he was cursed by the higher beings of his world and banished. He seeks every day for a chance to atone for his actions, and he's <span id="emphasis">this</span> close to going on a time-hopping journey to take down his former colleagues!</p>

                    <h2>What does he do?</h2>
                    <p>Estavius takes down his foes in combat by powering up his allies, summoning fantastical creatures, and slow-roasting his enemies with damage over time.</p>

                    <h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
                    <p>Estavius' character began as a silly sketch, which is the basis for his design and what you see on this page!</p>
